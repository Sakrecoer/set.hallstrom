  <h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>
  <p>My name is Set Hallstr&ouml;m, I am a 1980 born half-Swiss, half-Swedish humano&iuml;d. I spent my formative years in Sweden but moved to Switzerland when I was 7 years old and later to Spain at 25 to work as a free-lance graphic designer and music producer in the thriving scene of Electronic music of Barcelona. These moves helped me to develop my interest for different languages, and today I speak five fluently. I have a broad and genuine interest for people and this, combined with my well-developed communication skills, gives me the perfect tools to work with in social environments. I am reliable and upfront. One of my most appreciated skills is my attention to detail and my ability to remain clear in very stressful or difficult situations and communicate my calm.</p>
  <p>I have a big interest in graphic design, music production and I love to thinker about all the ways humans interact and communicate with each other. My schooling at <a target="_blank" href="https://edhea.ch/">&Eacute;cole Cantonale d'Art du Vallais</a> (Swiss Art-school, today known as EDHEA) and my experiences as free-lance graphic designer have given me deep knowledge of several tools for printed- / digital-publications, such as the complete Adobe products suit, several CMS systems including the codes and the mechanisms behind these digital-platforms such as: HTML, CSS, PHP mySQL and Apache. Free Open Source Software and DIY advocate, I have been volunteering as <a target="_blank" href="https://ubuntustudio.org/2016/04/new-ubuntu-studio-release-and-new-project-lead/">Project-Leader</a> for the multimedia flavour of the Operating System "Ubuntu" (<a target="_blank" href="https://ubuntustudio.org">UbuntuStudio.org</a>) and I am the initiator of the non-profit digital record-label and artist-management foundation <a target="_blank" href="https://basspistol.com">Basspistol.com</a></p>
  <p>When I am not working, I spend most of my time writing <a target="_blank" href="https://sakrecoer.com">music, poetry,</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/83261266">animating</a> or experimenting with my own <a target="_blank" href="https://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu servers.</a></p>
