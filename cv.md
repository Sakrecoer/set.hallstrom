I spent my formative years in Sweden but moved to Switzerland when I was 7 years old and later to Spain at 25 to work as a free-lance graphic designer and music producer in the thriving scene of Electronic music of Barcelona. These moves helped me to develop my interest for different languages, and today I speak five fluently. I have a broad and genuine interest for people and this, combined with my well-developed communication skills, gives me the perfect tools to work with in social environments. My schooling at [&Eacute;cole Cantonale d'Art du Vallais](https://edhea.ch/){: target="_blank"} (Swiss Art-school, today known as EDHEA) and my experiences as free-lance graphic designer have given me deep knowledge of several tools for printed- / digital-publications, such as the complete Adobe products suit, several CMS systems including the codes and the mechanisms behind these digital-platforms.

When I am not working, I spend most of my time writing [music, poetry,](https://sakrecoer.com/){: target="_blank"} [animating](https://vimeo.com/83261266){: target="_blank"} or experimenting with my own Ubuntu servers. Free Open Source Software and DIY advocate, I have also been volunteering as [Project-Leader](https://ubuntustudio.org/2016/04/new-ubuntu-studio-release-and-new-project-lead/){: target="_blank"} for the multimedia flavor of the Operating System "Ubuntu" ([UbuntuStudio.org](https://ubuntustudio.org/){: target="_blank"}) and am the initiator of the non-profit digital record-label and artist-management foundation [Basspistol.com](https://basspistol.com/){: target="_blank"}
