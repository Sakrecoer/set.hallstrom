<div class="column editable"><p>My name is Set Hallstr&ouml;m, I am a 1980 born half-Swiss, half-Swedish humanoid. I spent my formative years in Sweden but moved to Switzerland when I was 7 years old and later to Spain at 25 to work as a free-lance graphic designer and music producer in the thriving scene of Electronic music of Barcelona. These moves helped me to develop my interest for different languages, and today I speak five fluently. I have a broad and genuine interest for people and this, combined with my well-developed communication skills, gives me the perfect tools to work with in social environments. My schooling at <a target="_blank" href="https://edhea.ch/">&Eacute;cole Cantonale d'Art du Vallais</a> (Swiss Art-school, today known as EDHEA) and my experiences as free-lance graphic designer have given me deep knowledge of several tools for printed- / digital-publications, such as the complete Adobe products suit, several CMS systems including the codes and the mechanisms behind these digital-platforms.</p><p>When I am not working, I spend most of my time writing <a target="_blank" href="https://sakrecoer.com/">music, poetry,</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/83261266">animating</a> or experimenting with my own Ubuntu servers.
