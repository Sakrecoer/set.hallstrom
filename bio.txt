Set is a 30 year old half-Swiss, half-Swedish man. He spent his formative years in Sweden but moved to Switzerland when he was 7 years old. The move helped him to develop his interest for different languages, and today he speaks five fluently. He has a broad and genuine interest for people and this, combined with his well-developed communication skills, gives him the perfect tools to work with in social environments. Set is reliable and upfront. One of his most appreciated skills is his ability to remain clear and calm in very stressful environments or difficult situations while communicating with customers. When Set is not working, he spends most of his time writing music, poetry or experimenting with his own Ubuntu servers. He has got a big private interest in graphic design and music production, a deep knowledge of several tools for printed and digital publications, the complete Adobe products suit, HTML, CSS, and skills in PHP mySQL and apache.
