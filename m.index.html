 	<h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
	<p class="bio">My name is Set Hallström, I am a 1980 born half-Swiss, half-Swedish man. I spent my formative years in Sweden but moved to Switzerland when I was 7 years old and later to Spain at 25 to work as a free-lance graphic designer and music producer in the thriving scene of Electronic music of Barcelona. These moves helped me to develop my interest for different languages, and today I speaks five fluently. I have a broad and genuine interest for people and this, combined with my well-developed communication skills, gives me the perfect tools to work with in social environments. I am reliable and upfront. One of my most appreciated skills is my attention to detail and my ability to remain clear and calm in very stressful or difficult situations while communicating with customers.<br /><br />

When I am not working, I spend most of my time writing <a href="http://sakrecoer.com" target="_blank">music, poetry,</a> <a href="https://vimeo.com/83261266" target="_blank">animating</a> or experimenting with my own <a href="http://ubuntu.com" target="_blank">Ubuntu servers.</a> I have got a big interest in graphic design music production. My schooling at <a href="http://ecav.ch" target="_blank">École Cantonale d'Art du Vallais</a> (Swiss Art-school) and my experiences as free-lance graphic designer have given me deep knowledge of several tools for printed- / digital-publications, such as the complete Adobe products suit, several CMS systems including the codes and the mechanisms behind these digital-platforms such as: HTML, CSS, PHP mySQL and Apache. Free Open Source Software and DIY advocate, I am also volunteering as <a href="http://ubuntustudio.org/2016/04/new-ubuntu-studio-release-and-new-project-lead/" target="_blank">Project-Leader</a> for the multimedia flavour of the Operating System "Ubuntu" (<a href="http://ubuntustudio.org" target="_blank">UbuntuStudio.org</a>) and the initiator of the non-profit digital record-label and artist-management foundation <a href="http://basspistol.com" target="_blank">Basspistol.com</a>
